## Depth-targeted geopotential modelling with spherical harmonics.

Python workflow that links geoid and gravity spectra to subsurface density, including PSO-optimised band-pass filters and the three synthetic test cases (shield, subduction, plumes) based on pySHtools (Mark A. Wieczorek and Matthias Meschede (2018). SHTools â€” Tools for working with spherical harmonics, Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems, 19, 2574-2592, doi:10.1029/2018GC007529.)
